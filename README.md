#Project on Wearable Tech

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. This project results in a tidy dataset from the raw data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 


The script in this repo:
-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Additional Files
This repo contains 1) the r script for the project and 2) a codebook detailing how the variables are defined.
